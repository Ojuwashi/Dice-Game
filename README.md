# Dice-Game
ðŸŽ² Simple Dice Roller - Pygame ðŸŽ²   This is my very first coding project, and I'm excited to share it with you! It's a simple dice rolling game built using Pygame. You can use this game while playing any board game or just for fun! I'm currently a student, and I hope you enjoy this little project of mine.
