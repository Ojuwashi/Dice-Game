ðŸŽ² Simple Dice Roller - Pygame ðŸŽ²

This is my very first coding project, and I'm excited to share it with you! It's a simple dice rolling game built using Pygame. The game features a centered dice and a "Roll Dice" button, making it perfect for those moments when you need a dice but donâ€™t have one handy. You can use this game while playing any board game or just for fun!

Features:
 â€¢ Centered Dice & Button: The dice and "Roll Dice" button are centered on the screen for easy use.
 â€¢ Perfect for Game Nights: Donâ€™t have a physical dice? No problem! Use this digital version for any game youâ€™re playing.

I'm currently a student, and I hope you enjoy this little project of mine. Your feedback is welcome as I continue to learn and improve!
